# Introduction

- Refactoring an E-commerce Store in Alpine.js.

# Challenges Faced

- It was when the sort by was not working as well as the Categories, When i press it it supposed to give the option of "lowest to highest" and "Highest to lowest" on that sort by modal.

# What i learnt

- i learnt that alpine works only on html,and that you code everything there even the Api's.
